# Nature of Code

[![License][license]][license-url]

This project is powered by Clerk.

## Dependencies

`clj`, `shadow-cljs`, `node` and

- [Clojure CLI tools](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure)
- [`babashka`](https://github.com/babashka/babashka#installation)

To publish to GitHub Pages, you'll also need `node` installed, preferably via
[`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

## Developing with Clerk

To start a server for local Clerk development, run

```sh
bb clerk-watch
```

This will start the Clerk server at http://localhost:7777 with a file
watcher that updates the page each time any file in the `notebooks` directory changes.

To manually start the Clerk webserver, start a REPL by running

```sh
clj
```

Then start the server:

```clj
(start!)
```

To show a file, pass it to `clerk/show!`:

```clj
(clerk/show! "notebooks/a_file.clj")
```

These commands work because dev/user.clj requires `nextjournal.clerk` under a
`clerk` alias, and defines a `start!` function.

## Static Builds

### Local Build

Run

```
bb build-static
```

To generate a static site locally.

### Push to GitHub
